system calls with pid usage can use speed optimalization

---------------------------------

vmprint() prints addresses of process data (on the 3th level) 

0. page -> code of the process 
2. page -> stack of the process 

user cannot access 1. page due to absenting user flag => to avoid stack overflow 

3th page from end contains usyscall
